## Usage Instructions

2. Once validation passes, click "Submit Product"

## Important Notes

### Development vs. Production

**Development Environment:**
- The API endpoint (`/api/admin/add-product`) works when running locally with `npm run dev`
- It directly modifies the `src/data/products.js` file
- Changes need to be committed to Git and deployed

**Production Environment (Vercel):**
- The filesystem is read-only in serverless environments
- The API endpoint will not work on Vercel
- Consider alternative approaches for production:
  - Use a database for product management
  - Use a headless CMS
  - Manually update products.js and redeploy

### Security Considerations

- The admin interface has a simple password gate (client-side)
- For production use, implement proper server-side authentication
- The `VITE_ADMIN_PASS` environment variable should be kept secret
- Consider adding rate limiting and CSRF protection

### Workflow Recommendation

For production use, we recommend:
1. Use this form locally during development
2. Test the JSON output thoroughly
3. Submit to add the product to products.js
4. Review the changes in Git
5. Commit and deploy through your normal CI/CD process

## File Structure

```
src/
  components/
    ProductForm.jsx           # Main form component
  pages/
    Admin.jsx                 # Admin dashboard (includes ProductForm)
api/
  admin/
    add-product.js            # API endpoint for adding products
```

## Technical Details

### Form Component
- Built with React and Tailwind CSS
- Uses React hooks for state management
- Real-time JSON generation
- Dynamic form fields based on selections

### API Endpoint
- Uses Babel parser to read and modify products.js
- Preserves code structure and formatting
- Inserts new products in correct position based on `appearance` value
- Handles all product properties including nested objects and arrays

### Validation Rules
- SKU: Required, must be unique
- Name (EN/HE): Both required
- Description (EN/HE): Both required
- Colors: At least one required
- Size Range: At least one required
- Base Price: Required, must be > 0
- Material (EN/HE): Both required

## Troubleshooting

**Form not appearing:**
- Ensure you're logged in to the admin dashboard
- Check that you're on the "Products" tab

**Submit button not working:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure all required fields are filled
- Verify the API endpoint is accessible (local dev only)

**JSON preview not updating:**
- Try toggling the preview off and on
- Check browser console for errors

**Changes not persisting:**
- Remember this only works in local development
- Check that you have write permissions to the file
- Verify products.js exists and is properly formatted
